## BlockListExploded Component

This is an experimental component being built to implement the exploded view in the site editor.
The potential goal for this component is to be a component that can be used by any block editor, so it's important to keep its dependencies minimal. (block-editor dependencies). Eventually, it should be moved to the `@wordpress/block-editor` package.
